## Description

SAVVIE is an e-commerce-based app connecting surplus foods from restaurants, cafes, and bakeries to consumers for a lower price. As a result, users eat great meals for less and food businesses receive extra revenue streams and additional brand visibility, all while together reducing food waste.

With our location-based mobile service, our partners can progressively reduce their food waste as it enables customers to find and rescue surplus food in their area. Every meal purchased via SAVVIE is one less meal thrown away, helping our communities to waste less and be more sustainable.
